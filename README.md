# dvk_probe

RP2040 Firmware for Ezurio DVKs (dev kits).

On many DVKs, an RP2040 is used for a USB to UART bridge and USB SWD programmer/debugger. This is the firmware that enables those features.

This firmware is based on Zephyr RTOS. See [the build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) for details on how to build the firmware.
