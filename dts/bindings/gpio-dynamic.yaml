  This allows you to define a group of GPIO that are configurable at run-time.
  Each pin is defined in a child node of the gpio-dynamic node.

  This example defines three children in the node /gpio_dynamic.

  The GPIO flags are ignored by the pi_dapi_gpio driver because they are
  set from the [Python] application.

  / {
     gpio_dynamic {
        compatible = "gpio-dynamic";
        test_point_0 {
           gpios = <&gpio0 1 0>;
           label = "TEST_POINT_0,TP0";
        };
        test_point_1 {
           gpios = <&gpio0 2 0>;
           label = "TEST_POINT_1";
        };
        test_point_2 {
           gpios = <&gpio1 15 0>;
        };
     };

            Human readable string describing the gpio. It can be used by an
            application/script to identify this test point or to retrieve 
            its number/index (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.
            Multiple names can be specified as a comma separated list.
